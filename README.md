# R lookup challenge

I was trying to solve an R challenge to update a dataframe based on records in a lookup table. [@dhmontgomery](https://twitter.com/dhmontgomery) came up with a workable solution, and I thank him for that. I was overthinking it, as per usual.

- I have a repeatable example in the RNotebook [00-lookup-challenge.Rmd](00-lookup-challenge.Rmd).
- I have a [pretty example example](https://critmcdonald.github.io/r-lookup-challenge/00-lookup-challenge.html) published as html.
